- Received a raspberry pi and made sure it was runnning. However the sd card that was already in it was faulty. 
  Aditionally when testing the the raspbery pi with the breadboard, one of our group members connected an external battery directly
  to the raspberry pi and ended up frying it. New rasperry pi is needed...

- Obtained a new sd card for the raspberry pi. 

- Installed Rasperry Pi Imager

- Flashed the rapserry pi with new image in preparation for ontaining new raspberry pi

- Rasperry Pi compatability with motors: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing/14

- Raspberry Pi itself cannot power motors, therefore motor controllers are necessary

- Ordered Motor controller L298N on amazon, waiting for it to come in mail. Decided it was the appropriate one after extensive research

- While waiting for motor controller, tried powering 5V DC motor directly from 12V Battery pack and the motor started burning... Decided it was best to wait

- Received motor controller and figured out wiring schematics to connect it to the motor and the raspberry pi

- Sucessfully connected all components and ran motor from Raspbian terminal

- Fleshed out code controlling the motor, variable input and correct spin direction

- Fiddled with different voltage outputs to see best ping pong bounce

- Decided best output was around 50-70 percent of maximum
