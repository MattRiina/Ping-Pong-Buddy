- Received a raspberry pi and made sure it was runnning. However the sd card that was already in it was faulty. 
  Aditionally when testing the the raspbery pi with the breadboard, one of our group members connected an external battery directly
  to the raspberry pi and ended up frying it. New rasperry pi is needed...

- Obtained a new sd card for the raspberry pi. 

- Installed Rasperry Pi Imager

- Flashed the rapserry pi with new image in preparation for ontaining new raspberry pi
